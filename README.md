# CURGLAFF Foundational Unity Packages
Set of foundational Unity packages: simple, modular, and covering a variety of basic needs within a game's codebase.

All the folders in the repository are either packages or collections of related packages. I've taken care to document them all; package folders explain what they each are and how to install them, and the Wiki documents how to actually *use* them.
