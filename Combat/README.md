# Combat System
The Combat System contains the most basic datatypes required to make any form of combat, and a number of generic systems a step up from that which are meant to be a base for practically any other genre of game.

Or, that's the plan. As it stands, there's only Action Combat that's been made.

To get a combat system into your project, begin by importing the base:
```
https://github.com/Koopa1018/CURGLAFF-UnityFoundation.git?path=/Combat/Base
```

Then, if you want a higher-up system, add its dependencies, then the package itself as a final step.
