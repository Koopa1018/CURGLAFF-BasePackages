# Input Containers
An abstraction layer to store inputs between the time they're fetched and the time they're used. Can be used to store inputs from any player, or from AIs simple or complex.

Please note: Because every game is different, no pre-built fields or field-writing systems are provided. You'll have to make those yourself by implementing
`IGenerateInputSignals` in a component.
