# Movement Components
Components to establish a neat pipeline for object movement.

Compatible with Unity's ECS package, for what it's worth, considering ECS is in preview.

# Checkout URLs
To add a Movement Components package, first add the Movement Base package:
```
https://github.com/Koopa1018/CURGLAFF-UnityFoundation.git?path=/Movement Components/Movement Base#5258aeff3fbb56598408a77261764ed3d945a66f
```

Then add the URL of whichever package you need for your game (both, in any order, if you need to).

*2D:*
```
https://github.com/Koopa1018/CURGLAFF-UnityFoundation.git?path=/Movement Components/Movement 2D#5258aeff3fbb56598408a77261764ed3d945a66f
```

*3D:*
```
https://github.com/Koopa1018/CURGLAFF-UnityFoundation.git?path=/Movement Components/Movement 3D#5258aeff3fbb56598408a77261764ed3d945a66f
```

# Packages
The Movement Component packages are functionally identical, apart from 2D versus 3D.
Movement 3D comes pre-packaged with a Collision Handler built around Unity's Character Controller component, which has no equivalent in 2D
(neither Character Controller nor Collision Handler, as a matter of fact).
